# 🧱 Design Patterns Examples — CE-1103

## 📘 Overview

This repository contains basic implementations of software design patterns created for the course CE-1103 — Algoritmos y Estructura de Datos I at Instituto Tecnológico de Costa Rica.

The main goal of this work is to demonstrate how classic object-oriented patterns can be structured and implemented in Java, using minimal examples for easy comprehension.

## 🧠 Included Patterns

- **Strategy Pattern**: Allows selecting an algorithm’s behavior at runtime.
- **Observer Pattern**: Enables a one-to-many dependency between objects so that changes in one object are automatically reflected in its dependents.

Each pattern is implemented in its own file with clear class structure and logic.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Language**: Java
- **IDE**: IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse (recommended)
